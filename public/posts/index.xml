            <description>Unfortunately, we can&amp;rsquo;t build resilience on success alone, learning from past mistakes is of prominent importance for successful future behavior.
It takes failure for us to build strength and work out how to deal with failure.
A life of unbroken success doesn&amp;rsquo;t test us; if we are untested, then we are unprepared for what might come.
The same thing can be said about systems and services.
This is what most businesses fail to understand.</description>
